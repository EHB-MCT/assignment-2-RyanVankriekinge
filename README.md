# Python pygame platformer
A simple collision detection game created with Python's Pygame library. There's enemies moving around the screen and 
the player needs to avoid hitting the enemies by moving with the arrow keys or with WASD.

This project currently contains only dummy code that shows the conventions used when coding with Python (and more 
specifically, Pygame).
